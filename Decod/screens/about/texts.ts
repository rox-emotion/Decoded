export const aboutDecoded = "De.Coded is a research-based exploration of the human capital of Silicon Valley. The four-year project was built on the foundation of a year-long nomination process, where a diverse group of local leaders nominated individuals from their own communities who are making significant contributions to the region and represent the very best of service to society. The final 101 nominees frame many of the most important stories of this remarkable valley. However, they represent only a fraction of the Bay area’s exceptional residents. \nThe project maps these remarkable people though photographic portraits, oral histories and ancestral DNA mapping to create a deeper understanding of the peninsula and beyond. The Human Atlas project holds a mirror up to society and encourages audiences to question their own roles and responsibilities to their communities, cities, and fellow human beings.\nThe work is available as a book, a museum exhibition and in multiple digital formats. \n"
export const aboutHA = "Human Atlas projects harness extensive anthropological research to create multi-layered narratives of our time through portraits, DNA science and oral-history soundtracks. The projects are multi-discipline, social-impact initiatives created by artist Marcus Lyon. \nOver the last decade Lyon and his team have produced exhibitions, immersive architectural projection events and books on Brazil, Germany, Detroit, and Silicon Valley. He is currently making a new Atlas in collaboration with the Getty about Los Angeles. To date over 500 nominated agents of change from across the planet have become part of the project. \nHuman Atlases are significant legacy works that unlock deep narratives and conserve human geography for future generations. In each Atlas 100 selected nominees’ extraordinary life stories, portraits and DNA maps are brought together to engage the broadest of audiences and inspire a deeper understanding of humanity — past, present, and future. \nEvery Atlas is built on an extensive nomination process, where a diverse group of leaders from across the spectrum nominate individuals from their communities who represent the very best of society, those who are championing and driving sustainable change in all its forms: from public servants to entrepreneurs, from non-profit leaders and activists to artists and scientists. The work gives voice to these remarkable people and holds a mirror up to our societies while questioning the audience’s role and responsibilities to their communities, cities, and fellow human beings. \n"
